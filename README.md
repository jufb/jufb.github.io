<h1>Greetings! Ol√°!</h1>
<h3>My name is Juliana, and I live in Ontario, Canada. I am looking for innovation, new opportunities, and challenging projects.</h3>
I have been a technology enthusiast since childhood. I published my first website in my fifteens during my technical high school in Data Processing.<br/>
I have bachelor's degree in Computer Science, two graduate certificates in Software Engineering, and Project Management.<br/>
Then, I accumulated ten years of experience, as a developer, business analyst, and finally, a technical leader.<br/>
